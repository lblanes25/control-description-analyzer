| WHO | 30% | Critical for accountability and audit traceability |
| WHAT | 30% | Essential for control execution clarity |
| WHEN | 25% | Regulatory compliance and operational timing |
| WHY | 12% | Risk alignment and business justification |
| ESCALATION | 3% | Exception handling and governance |

**Weight Selection Justification:**
- **WHO/WHAT Priority**: Combined 60% reflects audit focus on "who does what"
- **WHEN Significance**: 25% acknowledges regulatory emphasis on control timing
- **WHY Balance**: 12% ensures risk linkage without over-penalizing concise controls

Any unresolved variances are investigated and escalated to the CFO within 2 business days with supporting documentation."*

**Scoring Breakdown:**
- **WHO** (30%): 95 points + bonuses (specific role +2, system reference +2)
- **WHAT** (30%): 92 points + bonuses (quantitative threshold +3, technology +2, evidence +2)
- **WHEN** (25%): 94 points + bonuses (explicit timing +2, deadline clarity +1)
