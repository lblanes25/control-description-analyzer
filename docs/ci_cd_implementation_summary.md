### Quality Enforcement

| Quality Gate | Threshold | Enforcement |
|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Test Pass Rate | 100% (P1 tests) | ❌ Pipeline failure |
| Code Coverage | ≥ 85% | ❌ Pipeline failure |
| Performance | All benchmarks pass | ❌ Pipeline failure |
| Security Scan | No critical issues | ⚠️ Warning logged |
| Code Quality | Pylint ≥ 7.0 | ⚠️ Warning logged |
