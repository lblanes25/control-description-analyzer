        self.advanced_radio = QRadioButton("Advanced Mode (Weighted Scoring)")
        
        # Connect signals for mode switching
        self.simple_radio.toggled.connect(self.on_mode_changed)
        self.advanced_radio.toggled.connect(self.on_mode_changed)
    
    def on_mode_changed(self):
        # Update analyzer mode and refresh results if needed
